This is an analysis of scheduled vrs honoured appointments by patients across multiple cities in Brazil

In the dataset, the column names 'ScheduledDay' tells when appointment was scheduled to take place, 'AppointmentDay' refers to the actual day the patient met the Doctor, 'Neighborhood' refers to the Hospital's location and 'Scholarship' indicates if a patient has or doesn't have a scholarship. The 'No-show' column indicates 'No - meaning patient honoured the appointment' and 'Yes - meaning patient didn't honour the appointment'. Sms_received indicates a '0' for patients not contact via sms to remind them of theri appointmet and '1' represents otherwise
